# SQL for Data Engineering Learning Project

This repository is my personal learning journey to master **SQL for Data Engineering**. The focus is on practical, production-relevant SQL skills that frequently appear in data engineering job requirements and real-world ETL tasks.

## 🎯 Goal

Build strong, practical SQL skills for data engineering roles through hands-on practice with real-world scenarios.

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Fundamentals
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, handling duplicates)
- Aggregations with GROUP BY
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- CASE statements for data cleaning

### Phase 2: Advanced Transformations
- Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG/LEAD, running totals)
- Subqueries vs JOINs
- Handling NULLs and data quality
- Date/time manipulation

### Phase 3: Production Patterns
- Incremental loading
- Deduplication techniques
- Idempotent queries
- Basic query optimization

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. **Choose your SQL environment**
   - PostgreSQL
   - BigQuery
   - Snowflake
   - DB Fiddle
   - Or any SQL environment you prefer

3. **Start learning**
   - Navigate to Phase 1 to begin
   - Open SQL files in your chosen environment
   - Run and experiment with the queries
   - Complete exercises to reinforce learning

## 💡 Learning Approach

- **Hands-on practice** - Every concept includes runnable examples
- **Real-world scenarios** - Problems mirror actual data engineering tasks
- **Progressive difficulty** - Build skills incrementally from fundamentals to advanced patterns
- **Production-focused** - Learn patterns used in professional environments

## 🛠️ Technologies

This repository focuses on standard SQL that works across:
- PostgreSQL
- MySQL
- BigQuery
- Snowflake
- Redshift

Platform-specific syntax is noted where applicable.

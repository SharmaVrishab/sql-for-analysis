# SQL for Data Engineering

This repository is focused on **SQL practice for Data Engineering** using LeetCode problems.

## Why this repo

The goal is to build strong SQL skills used in data engineering work:

- writing clean analytical queries
- handling joins, aggregations, and window functions
- improving query readability and correctness
- practicing interview-style SQL problems

## Project Structure

```text
src/leetcode_problems/
├── easy/
│   ├── joins/
│   └── date_functions/
├── medium/
│   ├── aggregation/
│   └── sequences/
└── hard/
    ├── sequences/
    └── window_functions/
```

## File Naming Convention

For each problem:

- SQL solution: `<id>_<slug>.sql`
- Optional notes: `<id>_<slug>.md`

Example:

- `src/leetcode_problems/easy/joins/0175_combine_two_tables.sql`
- `src/leetcode_problems/easy/joins/0175_combine_two_tables.md`

## How to use

1. Pick one SQL problem.
2. Place it in the correct `difficulty/topic` folder.
3. Add notes for approach and edge cases if needed.
4. Keep one problem per file pair.

## Long-term goal

Create a clean, searchable SQL problem bank for data engineering interview prep and daily SQL practice.

# SQL for Data Engineering Learning Project

This repository is my personal learning journey to master **SQL for Data Engineering**.

The focus is on practical, production-relevant SQL skills that frequently appear in data engineering job requirements and real-world ETL tasks.

## Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Fundamentals
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, handling duplicates)
- Aggregations with GROUP BY
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- CASE statements for data cleaning

### Phase 2: Advanced Transformations
- Window functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, LAG/LEAD, running totals)
- Subqueries vs JOINs
- Handling NULLs and data quality
- Date/time manipulation

### Phase 3: Production Patterns
- Incremental loading
- Deduplication techniques
- Idempotent queries
- Basic query optimization

Each SQL file contains:
- Clear explanations
- Sample data
- Example queries
- Notes on best practices

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`
2. Open the SQL files in your preferred environment (PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, DB Fiddle, etc.)
3. Run and experiment with the queries

## Goal
Build strong, practical SQL skills for data engineering roles.

Happy learning! 🚀
